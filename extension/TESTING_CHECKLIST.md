- [ ] Check `emotes` object store contains data
- [ ] Verify emote objects have proper structure:
  - `key` (emote name)
  - `url` (original URL)
  - `blob` (image data)
  - `type` (MIME type)
  - `size` (blob size)
  - `timestamp`
  - `channel` (source channel)

### ‚úÖ Chrome Storage Usage
- [ ] Open DevTools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí Extension

  - `channelIds` array
  - `channels` metadata
  - `emoteMapping` (URL lookup)
- [ ] No `emoteImageData` with base64 (old format cleaned up)

### ‚úÖ Large Collection Handling
- [ ] Test with 500+ emotes (add multiple large channels)
- [ ] Download completes without timeout
- [ ] UI remains responsive during download
- [ ] Memory usage stays reasonable
- [ ] No browser crashes or freezes

### ‚úÖ Storage Efficiency
- [ ] Check total storage usage (should be significantly less than base64)
- [ ] Verify blob storage vs URL fallback
- [ ] Test with different image formats (webp, png, gif)
- [ ] Animated emotes work correctly

## üîÑ Update & Sync Tests

### ‚úÖ Incremental Updates
- [ ] Add new channel to existing list
- [ ] Only new emotes download (existing ones skipped)
- [ ] Progress shows correct new emote count
- [ ] Existing emotes remain functional

### ‚úÖ Channel Removal
- [ ] Remove one channel from list and save
- [ ] Automatic cleanup removes associated emotes
- [ ] Toast notification confirms cleanup
- [ ] Remaining channels' emotes still work
- [ ] Storage size decreases appropriately

### ‚úÖ Complete Data Clear
- [ ] Click "Clear All Data" button
- [ ] Confirmation dialog appears
- [ ] All channel IDs cleared
- [ ] All emotes removed from UI
- [ ] IndexedDB cleared
- [ ] Chrome storage cleaned up
- [ ] Toast confirms: "Channel IDs cleared - storage cleaned up"

## üö® Error Handling Tests

### ‚úÖ Network Issues
- [ ] Disconnect internet during download
- [ ] Verify retry logic activates
- [ ] Failed emotes show in console but don't stop others
- [ ] Reconnect internet and retry manually
- [ ] Previously failed emotes download successfully

### ‚úÖ Invalid Data
- [ ] Enter non-existent channel ID (e.g., `fakechannel123`)
- [ ] Download skips invalid channels gracefully
